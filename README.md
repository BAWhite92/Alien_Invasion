# Alien_Invasion
A test project using textbook guidance to create a game using Pygame to generate a 2D alien invaders game.

Players control a tank that appears at the bottom of the screen. The player can move the tank from left to right usig the arrow keys on their keyboard and shoot bullets to destory aliens using the spacebar. When the game starts a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across the screen gradually moving down closer to the player and if the player successfully shoots down all the aliens a new fleet will appear which will move even faster than the previous one.

Players lose a life if any of the aliens reach the bottom of the screen, if all three lives are lost the game will end!

Use arrow keys to move, Q quits the game. Space bar to shoot.
